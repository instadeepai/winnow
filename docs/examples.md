For a comprehensive example demonstrating the full winnow workflow, see our example notebook:

📓 **[FDR plots example notebook](https://github.com/instadeepai/winnow/blob/main/examples/getting_started_with_winnow.ipynb)**

This notebook shows you how to:

- Load and prepare PSM data using `CalibrationDataset`
- Train a confidence calibrator with `ProbabilityCalibrator`
- Apply FDR control using different methods
- Generate visualisation plots for calibration and FDR analysis
